#Homework 2
##Problem 1
Old McDonald wants to sell his last strawberry harvest using price differentiation. He knows that there are 2 market segments of equal size that like strawberries: foodies and normal people. If the strawberries have a label that reads "NON GMO and organic", foodies are willing to pay up to \$400 for the strawberries while normal people will be willing to pay  \$100 for labeled strawberries. Unlabeled strawberries are  worth \$75 to normal people, but are worth \$125 to foodies. The strawberries have been grown already so all the costs, including labels are sunk.

1. Write down the self-selection and participation constraints given that the Old McDonald wants foodies to buy the labeled strawberries and normal people to buy the unlabeled version.
2. What are the optimal prices? 

##Problem 2
For the Cournot example given in class. Compare the total welfare generated by a market served by the two firms to the welfare under a monopoly. 

##Problem 3
The inverse demand for a market is given by

$$P=100-2Q$$

There are 3 firms in the market producing homogeneous goods with constant marginal cost $c_1=c_2=1$ and $c_3=2$. 

1. Write down the profit function for each firm.
2. Find the reactions function for the firms.
3. Solve for the Nash-Cornot equiliibrium. 
4. Compute the profits. What would happen to the profits earned by each firm if a firm enters the market?
5. Suppose that firms 3 and 1 merge. Compute the new equilibrium. 


##Problem 4
Two competing firms A and B are deciding what price to charge
for their goods. They know that there are 60 consumers with a reservation price of \$500 for the good, and another \$120 with the lower reservation price of \$220. If the two firms set a common price, they share equally all those customers willing to pay that price. On the cost side, suppose that the unit cost of serving a single consumer for either company is \$200. Let us also assume that each firm is limited to produce 200 units every day. Consider only the next pricing strategies. One is to set a high price of \$500. Another is to set a low price of \$220. 

1. Write down the game in normal form
2. Find the Nash Equilibria.
