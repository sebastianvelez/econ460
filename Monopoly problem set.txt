1. The monthly demand for widgets is given in inverse form by $P=1000 − 0.025Q$ and the
supply is given by $P = 150 + 0.033Q$ ($Q$ represents the total quantity)
a. Calculate the equilibrium price and quantity.
b. Calculate consumer and producer surplus.

2. The cost of producing drums for a typical firm is given by $C(q) = 2q + 2q^2$ (q is the output of just one firm).
a. Show that the supply for an individual firm is $q = \frac{P}{4}− \frac{1}{2}$
b. There are 100 identical firms in the industry. Find the industry supply assuming the firms behave competitively.
c. Find price, quantity and Welfare.
d. Now suppose the firms form a cartel that maximizes joint profit. Find the price and quantity and the DWL.

A monopolist that maximizes profit sells $1000$ homogeneous nail clippers at a price of $\$1000$ in Tucson. At this price the elasticity is -$2$. The marginal cost of producing nail clippers is increasing.

1. The cost of producing one more nail clipper for the monopolist is
	a. $\$1,000$
	b. less than $\$1,000$
c. zero
d. greater than $\$1,000$


2. The producer surplus is
a. $ \$1,000$
b. $\$1,000,000$
c. more than $\$1,000,000$
d. less than $\$1,000,000$

3. If the monopolist sold one more nail clipper the price would be
a. approximately $\$995$
b. approximately $\$999.5$
c. approximately $\$999$
d. it would remain constant

4. If the monopolist sold one more nail clipper its total income would
a.  increase by $\$499.5$
b. decrease by $\$499.5$
c. increase approximately by $\$999$
d. remain the same

5. Now suppose that the same firm has access to the state (Arizona) market of nail clippers where the firm can sell any amount at $1000. In Tucson however the firm is still a monopoly ant the firm can charge a different price than in the rest of the state. To maximize profits the amount of nail clippers that the firm needs to sell in Tucson is
a. 1000
b. more than 1000
c. zero
d. less than 1000

6. Suppose that Tucson’s market is now open and nail clippers can be imported from other
places in the state. The amount of nail clippers sold in Tucson will be
a. 1000
b. more than 1000
c. zero
d. less than 1000
