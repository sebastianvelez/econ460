2 monopolies are involved in the production of goods: *Primera* produces inputs that *Ultimo* uses to produce the final good. The marginal costs for *Primero* are constant ($c=4$). *Ultima* faces a demand given by:

$$Q=20-P$$

1.  Find the prices, quantities, profits and consumer surplus when the firms act as independent monopolies.
