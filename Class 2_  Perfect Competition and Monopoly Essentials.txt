#Perfect Competition

##Solution to Problem 4 (HW 1)
Suppose there is a perfectly competitive industry where all the firms are identical with identical cost curves. Furthermore, suppose that a representative firm’s total cost is given by 
$$C(q)= 100 + q^2+q$$
where $q$ is the quantity of output produced by thefirm. You also know that the market demand for this product is given by the equation 
$$P =1000 – 2Q$$ 
where $Q$ is the market quantity. In addition you are told that the market supply curve is given by the equation 
$$P = 100 + Q.$$


1. What is the the equilibrium quantity and price in this market?
>To find the equilibrium set market demand equal to market supply: $1000 – 2Q =100 + Q$. Solving for $Q$, you get $Q = 300$. Plugging $300$ back into either the market demand curve or the market supply curve you get $P = 400$.)

2. The firm’s MC equation based upon its $TC$ equation is $MC = 2q + 1$. Given this information and your answer in part (1), what is the firm’s profit maximizing level of production, total revenue, total cost and profit at this market equilibrium? Is this a short-run or long-run equilibrium? Explain your answer.
> From part (a) you know the equilibrium market price is \$400. You also know that the firm profit maximizes by producing that level of output where MR = MC. Since the equilibrium market price is the firm’s marginal revenue you know that MR = \$400. Setting MR = MC gives you 400 = 2q + 1, or q = 199.5. Thus, the profit maximizing level of output for the firm is 199.5 units when the price is \$400 per unit. Using this information it is easy to find total revenue as the price times the quantity: TR = (\$400 per unit)(199.5 units) = \$79,800. Total cost is found by   substituting q = 199.5 into the TC equation: TC = \$40,099.75. Profit is the difference between TR and TC: Profit = TR – TC = 79,800 – 40,099.75 = \$39,700.25. Since profit is not equal to zero this cannot be a long-run equilibrium situation: it must be a short-run equilibrium situation.

3. Given your answer in part (b), what do you anticipate will happen in this market in the long-run?
>Since there is a positive economic profit in the short run, there should be entry of firms in the long-run resulting in an increase in the market quantity, a decrease in the market price, and firms in the industry earning zero economic profit.)
4. In this market, what is the long-run equilibrium price and what is the  long-run equilibrium quantity for a representative firm to produce? Explain your answer.
>The long-run equilibrium price is that price that results in the representative firm earning zero economic profit. This will occur when MC = ATC for the representative firm. ATC is just the TC equation divided by q. Thus, 2q + 1 = (100 + q2 + q)/q. Solving for q, q = 10. Plugging 10 in for q into the ATC equation yields the following: ATC = (100 + 102 + 10)/10 = 21. So, when Price equals MR = min ATC = MC = \$21, this firm will break even. To see this compute TR for the firm when it produces 10 units and sells each unit for \$21: TR = $210. Notice that this is the same as the firm’s TC: thus, the firm earns zero economic profit.

5. Given the long-run equilibrium price you calculated in part (d), how many units of this good are produced in this market?
>To find this quantity you need to substitute $21 (the long-run equilibrium price) into the market demand curve to determine the quantity that the market must produce in order to be in long-run equilibrium. This quantity is equal to 489.5 units. 

##Welfare
Welfare is a measure of the overall value created in a market. It is computed as the sum of two entities: consumer surplus and producer surplus. 

Consumer Surplus
: is the sum of the differences between willingness to pay and price paid over all units  bought. Formally is the area under the demand curve and above the price.

Producer Surplus
: is the sum of the differences of the marginal profit, $P-MC$ across all units sold.

Welfare is maximized when the market is competitive. 

##Long run and short run
Economists define long run and short run in weird way: it has nothing to do with time. Instead we say that a market is in short run equilibrium if firms are making profits. Alternatively, firms in a long run equilibrium should make zero profits. Once firms make zero profits, there are no incentives for new firms to enter. 

#Price elasticity of demand
Elasticity of demand measures the response of the quantity demanded to small changes in prices. It would be crucial to understand it well how monopolies operate. It is defined as
$$\eta=\frac{\partial log(Q)}{\partial log (P)}=\frac{\partial Q}{\partial P} \frac{P}{Q}	$$

#Marginal revenue
Defines the change in revenue due to a small change in output. Formally, 

$$MR=\frac {\partial P(Q)Q}{\partial{Q}}$$

There is an interesting relationship between Marginal Revenue and Elasticity:
$$MR=\left[1+\frac{1}{\eta}\right]$$

Relationship between the MR and the demand
: Something very useful is that for linear demands, the marginal revenue curve is the same demand curve, just with twice the slope.
>*proof*
>Let the demand be $P=a+bQ$, then the revenue 
>$PQ=aQ+bQ^2$
>taking partials to find the marginal revenue
>$\frac {\partial P(Q)Q}{\partial{Q}}=a+2bQ$
>*QED*


#Monopoly Essentials

##The Monopolist's problem
Suppose a market with inverse demand given by $P=p(Q)$. The problem faced by the manager of a firm that operates alone in this market is finding a quantity $Q$ that maximizes her profit. Formally,

$$\max_Q p(Q)Q-C(Q)$$
where $C(Q)$ is the cost function. 
The FOC for this problem when $Q$ is a scalar is:
>$$p'(Q)Q+p(Q)-C'(Q)=0$$

Note that the term $p'(Q)Q+p(Q)$ is the marginal revenue and $C'(Q)$ is the marginal cost, so the condition for profit maximization can be written as
>$$MC=MR=\left[1+\frac{1}{\eta}\right]$$

 The marginal revenue has two parts. First, $p'(Q)Q$, reflects the change in price for the inframarginal units. Second, $p(Q)$ reflects the revenue generated by selling one more unit (the marginal one).

Lerner Index
: It is a measure of market power. It is defined as 
$$\mathcal{L}=\frac{P-MC}{P}=-\frac{1}{\eta} $$
 
## Output distortion
A  monopoly will *always* sell less than the efficient quantity at a higher price. To note this, not that the condition for profit maximization implies that $MC<P$
