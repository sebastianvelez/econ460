##Second degree price discrimination
Second degree price discrimination is used when the firm cannot tell consumers apart. The idea is to make different types of consumers self select into the goods the firm wants them to buy. 

###Setup
2 types of consumers
: Consumers with high willingness to pay (H) and consumers with low willingness to pay (L).

Pricing scheme

: Ideally the firm would like to set prices based on type, but can't do so (why?). The firm then does the second best thing: find prices	$P_H$ and $P_L$ such that type H consumers buys good H and type L consumers buy good L (Self-selection).

How to find such prices entails 2 sets of conditions. 

Participation constraints
: Prices cannot be too high or consumers may not buy them. Formally this can be written as
> $$u_H(x_H)-P_H\ge0$$
> $$u_L(x_L)-P_L\ge0$$

Self-selection constraints
: For each type, the prices have to make the corresponding good more attractive than the other.

>$$u_H(x_H)-P_H\ge u_H(x_L)-P_L$$
$$u_L(x_L)-P_L\ge u_L(x_H)-P_H$$

In general finding these prices requires:
1. Charging the "low demand" types their willingness to pay (leaving them with zero net utility): $P_L=u_L(x_L)$.
2. Charging the the "high demand" types just enough so that they are indifferent between the two options. 

At the optimal prices only two constraints are binding: low type participation constraint and high type self-selection constraint.  In words this mean: make sure low type is indifferent between buying or not and high type is indifferent between low and high products.

##Strategic interaction
 We have studied monopolies and competitive firms so far. Now we turn our attention to market structures where the profits a firm makes depend on what the rivals do. This is called strategic interaction. Monopolies by definition don't interact with other firms, so they alone have the control of their profits. In a competitive market the number of firms is so big that there is no place for interaction, so again, each firm is the sole responsible for its profits.  Recall the problems faced by monopolies and competitive firms
>Moopoly $$\max_Q p(Q)Q-C(Q)$$
>Competitive$$\max_q pq-C(q)$$

As long as this firm chose the right $q$ and $Q$ nothing else matters.

###Cournot oligopoly
Suppose that 2 firms producing homogeneous goods and constant cost per unit given by $c$. The inverse market demand is given by

$$P=a-bQ$$ and $a>0$ and $b>0$.

where $Q=q_1+q_2$

First let's write the profit function for each firm to see that each profit function depends on the other firms output

Profit firm 1
: $$\pi^1(q_1,q_2)=q_1(a-b(q_1+q_2))-cq_1$$

Profit firm 1
: $$\pi^2(q_1,q_2)=q_2(a-b(q_1+q_2))-cq_2$$

The key difference between what we have done in the past and this is the presence of a rival's decision on a firm's profit. A firm is no longer the sole responsible for its profits. It is the interaction between the firms what determines them.

The problem for firm 1 is then

>$$\max_{q_1}q_1 p(q_1+q2)-C_1(q_1)$$

The FOC for firm 1 looks like

$$a-2bq_1-bq_2-c=0$$
if we assume constant marginal cost $c_1$. Solving for $q_1$ as a function of $q_2$ we find firm's 1 *best response function*

>$$q_1(q_2)=\frac{a-bq_2-c}{2b}=\frac{a-c}{2b}-\frac{1}{2}q_2$$

Similarly for firm 2 we can find  its best response function

> $$q_2(q_1)=\frac{a-c}{2b}-\frac{1}{2}q_1$$

In equilibrium each firm has to choose a quantity that is a best response to its rival. After plugging one reaction function into the other we get

>$$q_1^*=\frac{a-c}{3b}=q_2^*$$
