#Bertrand practice

Assume that two firms sell differentiated products and face the following demand curves:

>$Q_1 = 100 – P_1 + \frac{1}{2}P_2$
>$Q_2 = 100 – P_2 +\frac{1}{2}P_1$
the marginal cost is the same for both firms $c=10$. 

1. The firms have to find the price that maximizes their profits. 
- Find the best response function for eah firm
- Show the best responses in a graph
- Find the Nash equilibrium and show it in the graph
- How much is produced by each firm? What are the firms' profits?


##Food for thought
Suppose that firm 1 is the leader and gets to choose its price first. What should firm 2 do?
