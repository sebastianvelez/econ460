#Solutions HW1
##Problem 1
1. Set up the cost minimization problem and find the first order conditions. Solve for $K*$
2.  Use $K*$ and first order conditions to replace $K$ and $L$ in $wL+rK$
3. Take derivative of the cost function found on (2) with respect to $K$. They mean that the marginal costs is equal to the marginal spenditure on inputs.

##Problem 2
Even during the warm month the taqueria should operate. The lease is a sunk cost. It doesn't matter when it comes to the decision whether to operate or not every month.

##Problem 3
