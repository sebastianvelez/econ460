##The Monopolist's problem
Suppose a market with inverse demand given by $P=p(Q)$. The problem faced by the manager of a firm that operates alone in this market is finding a quantity $Q$ that maximizes her profit. Formally,

$$\max_Q p(Q)Q-C(Q)$$
where $C(Q)$ is the cost function. 
The FOC for this problem when $Q$ is a scalar is:
>$$p'(Q)Q+p(Q)-C'(Q)=0$$

Note that the term $p'(Q)Q+p(Q)$ is the marginal revenue and $C'(Q)$ is the marginal cost, so the condition for profit maximization can be written as
>$$MC=P\left[1+\frac{1}{\eta}\right]$$

 The marginal revenue has two parts. First, $p'(Q)Q$, reflects the change in price for the inframarginal units. Second, $p(Q)$ reflects the revenue generated by selling one more unit (the marginal one).

Note 2 things implied by the profit maximization:
1. A monopoly al ways charges a price above marginal cost.
2. At the  profit maximizing quantity price is higher thanmarginal revenue. 
> Monopolies always sell in the elastic part of its demand curve. So $|\eta|>1$ which means that $\left[1+\frac{1}{\eta}\right]<1$. For example if $\eta=-3$ then $MC=\frac{1}{3}P$

 Output distortion
: A  monopoly will *always* sell less than the efficient quantity at a higher price. To note this, not that the condition for profit maximization implies that $MC<P$

Deadweight loss
: Monopolies tend to create a dead-weight losses (DWL). The DWL comes from the fact that $P>MC$. There is a gap between the marginal willingness to pay and and the cost of producing one more unit of the good.

##Multi-plant monopoly
A monopoly that has decided to produce $Q^m$ and can produce in 2 different plant faces the following problem when allocating the production:
$$\min_{q_1,q_2}C_1(q_1)+C_2(q_2)$$ subject to 
$$q_1+q_2=Q^m$$

The same problem can be easily solved by incorporating the restriction like so
$$\min_{q_1}C_1(q_1)+C_2(Q^m-q_1)$$ 


The first order condition for this problem is

$$MC_1(q_1)+MC_2(q_2)(-1)=0$$
which is more naturally written as
$$MC_1(q_1)=MC_2(q_2)$$

The production across plants has to equalize the marginal costs. 

##Regulation of Monopoly
Marginal Cost pricing
: To reduce the DWL sometimes governments want to regulate monpolies. Ideally a regulator would like to have a monopoly that charges $P=MC$. The potential problem (if the monopoly is natural) is that the monopoly could incur losses, since at *any* level of production $MC<AC$. If the good provided by the monopoly is regarded as important for consumers, the government would cover the monopoly's losses (subsidize).

Average Cost pricing
: An alternative is to make the monopoly charge at average cost. This way the quantity provided is higher than the unregulated monopoly (not as many units as competition though) and the monopoly incur no losses.

Two  part tariff
: The main problem with the natural monopoly comes from the high fixed costs ($F=500$). If the fixed costs could be transferred to the consumers the monopoly could produce the efficient amount.
