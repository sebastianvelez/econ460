##Problem 1
Suppose that the inverse demand for paragliders in Annecy is given by $p=130-Q$. There are currently 20 identical firms that produce paragliders in the area. The unit cost of producing a paraglider is constant and equal to $30$. Firms in this industry compete in quantities.

1. Show that in aCournot equilibrium the profit for each firm is $\pi=22.67$

2. Now suppose that 6 firms merge. Show that the profit of each firm in the post merger Cournot game is $39.06$

2. Show that the profit earned by the merged firm is not enough to compensate all the owners who owned the original six firms in the pre merger market. 

##Problem 2

Honda and Toyota are considering building a plant in the US. They can decide not to build, build a small plant or a big plant. The next matrix of payoffs describes the profits for each combination of strategies, with Honda choosing rows and Toyota choosing columns

|.|Big|Small|Don't build|
|:---|:--:|:--:|:---:|
|Big|0,0|12,8|18,9|
|Small|8,12|16,16|22,15|
|Don't Build|9,18|15,22|18,18|

1. Which strategy is strictly dominated?
2. When Honda chooses "Big" what is  Toyota's best response?
3. Find the Nash equilibrium (in pure strategies).

##Problem 3
Two firms compete in the market of homogeneous used cars.  The cost function for each firm is given by $$C=5,000+600Q+q^	2$$ and the demand for used cars is given by $$Q=300-\frac{1}{10}P$$
1.By regulations the firms can only  set two prices: $$P=2000$$
 and $$P=1500$$ Write down the normal for game and find the Nash equilibrium.
