##Main street breweries

1. There are two barbershops located on Main Street, which have different
unit cost. 
- The low cost one, Manny's, is located at the east end of Main street ($x=0$). 
- The fancy brewery, Floyd's, is located at the west end of the street ($x=1$). 

	```sequence
Floyd's (x=0)->Manny's (x=1): Main St. (Length  1  mile.....)

	```
3. Manny's cost per haircut is $c_m$ while the cost of providing a haircut for Floyd's is $c_f$ ($c_m<c_f$).
4. On a given week there are 100 potential customers who live evenly spaced along main street and they get at most one haircut.
5. All these people are willing to pay up to $50 for a haircut.
6. The cost of travelling along Main Street is $5/mile.


Demand for each firm
: First we need to find the distance where the indifferent consumer lives for any pair of prices $p_f$ and $p_c$. For a consumer living at milestone $x$ to be indifferent we need
$$50-5x-p_f=50-(1-x)5-p_m$$

solving for $x$

>$$x=\frac{p_m-p_f+5}{10}.$$


Since there are 100 potential consumers along the mile stretch, the demand for Floyd's is (everybody west of $x$)

>$$q_f=100x=10p_m-10p_f+50$$

and the demand for Manny's is (everybody east of $x$)
>$$q_m=100(1-x)=10p_f-10p_m+50$$

Now that we have the demands we can find the best response functions for Floyd

>$$P_f=\frac{P_m+c_f+5}{2}$$

while for Manny

>$$P_m=\frac{P_f+c_m+5}{2}$$

It is worth noting that an increase in the cost of Floyd increases the price for Manny in equilibrium.

Now solving for the equilibrium prices, assuming $c_m=10$ and  $c_m=20$

We get $p_f=18.33$ and $p_m=21.67$

What allows firms to price over marginal cost?

: Product differentiation. Even though the haircuts were basically identical, the location of the barbershops made them differentiated.
