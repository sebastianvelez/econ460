#Price Discrimination
Price discrimination serves many purposes. Sometimes price discrimination helps to reduce the dead-weight loss created by a monopoly. Sometimes the monopolist simply makes more profits by using some sort of price discrimination. 

There are different kinds of price discrimination. 

##Perfect price discrimination (first-degree)

 - Monopolist sells product with downward-sloping demand curve.
 - Each consumer demands one unit: demand curve graphs number of consumers against their willingness-to-pay for the product.
 - Perfect price discrimination: charge each consumer her WTP.
 - Perfectly discriminating monopolist produces more than "regular" monopolist: both produce at q where $MC(Q) = MR(Q)$, but for PD
monopolist $MR(Q) = p(Q)$. PD monopolist produces at perfectly competitive outcome where $p(q) = MC(q)$!
 - No two consumers will pay the same prices, and $CS=0$
 - Perfectly discriminating monopolist makes much higher prots (takes away all of the consumer surplus).

#Third-degree price discrimination

 - The monopolist only knows demand functions for different groups of consumers. The groups differ in their price responsiveness.
 - The monopolist cannot distinguish between consumers in each group (i.e., resale possible within groups, not across groups).
	 - Student vs. adults tickets
	 - Senior discounts.
	 - domestic market vs. abroad
 - As many prices as different elasticities (inverse elasticity  rule).
 - Consumer welfare can increase. The more elastic group gets a lower price.


Formally, the problem faced by the a 3rd degree PD monopolist is
>$$\max_{q_1,q_2}p_1(q_1)q_1+p_2(q_2)q_2-C(q_1+q2)$$

The firs order conditions for this problem are
>$$MR_1=MC$$$$MR_2=MC$$

Together they imply that the marginal cost across markets should be equalized to maximize profits.
 Another way of expressing the profit maximization condition is that in each market the monopoly will set a price using the inverse elasticity rule.

>$$p_1\left[1+\frac{1}{\eta_1}\right]=MC$$$$p_2\left[1+\frac{1}{\eta_2}\right]=MC$$
With some algebra this two conditions can be re-written as

>$$\frac{p_1}{p_2}=\frac{\eta_1\eta_2+\eta_1}{\eta_1\eta_2+\eta_2}$$
From this expression it is clear that the price will be lower in the market with the higher elasticity of demand.
