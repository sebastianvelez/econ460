You have been hired as the CEO of Vandelay Industries the only gantry crane to load/unload cargo for ships arriving at the Port of Catoosa. Your engineering department reports that the cost of operating the crane is given by $C=F+Q$ where $Q$ is the daily number of containers unloaded and $F=500$ is the opportunity cost of operating the crane every day. Your economics department estimated the daily demand to be $Q=204-4P$ where $P$ is the price for loading/unloading a container.  The board of directors has given you some tasks (and assume that the board would like to maximize profits)

1.  Find out if the company is a *natural monopoly*. 
1. A member of the board wants to minimize costs. How many containers a day would be necessary to load/unload to minimize costs?
1. Find the price that should be charged.
8. Find the profits for the board and the consumer surplus for the town council.
9. Make a graph of all this things.


Vandelay acquired an abandoned wharf where old-school, artisanal loading/unloading of shipments can be done. The cost of operating the wharf is given by $C(Q_w)=\frac{1}{20}Q_w^2$, where $Q_w$ is the amount of containers loaded/unloaded through the wharf.

1. Find the marginal cost for the *firm* (using both facilities: the gantry crane and the wharf).
2. Show that the *total* number of containers and price won't change with the acquisition of the wharf.
3. How many containers have to be loaded/unloaded in each port to maximize profits?
4. Show in a graph.

The government wants to regulate the operation of the port. 

1. What price should Vandelay charge to maximize social efficiency (maximize social welfare)?
2. Is the price viable? Would the government need to subsidize the operation of the ports?
3. What would be the price if the government does not want to subsidize Vandelay but wants to increase welfare?
4. Compare 2 and 3 in a graph.

Ignore the government intervention now. The city will grant licenses for anybody willing to load/unload cargo from the shores (just in the same way as the wharf). The cost of the licenses is $F=50$.

1. Find the long run number of firms that will operate.
2. Find the long run price and number of containers loaded/unloaded daily.
