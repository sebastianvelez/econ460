#Vertical Mergers

Suppose 3 firms are involved in the final sale of a product: a manufacturer (M), a wholesaler (W) and a retailer (R). Each firm operates as a monopolist in it respective part of the process. The final demand in the market (retail) is given by $P=100-Q$ where Q is the quantity sold by the retailer. The unit cost for the manufacturer is $c=10$.  **M** sells it product to **W** at a price $P_m$. The cost for **W** to bring the product to the retailer is $p_m+5$ and it charges $P_w$ to **R**. The cost for **R** is $P_w+5$ and sells its product to the public at a price $P$

##Each firm for itself

The retailer's marginal revenue is given by:

$$MR_R=100-2Q$$

To maximize profits the retailer has to sell a quantity that equalize that marginal revenue with the marginal cost, that is

$$100-2Q=P_w+5$$

Solving for $Q$ we get the the quantity sold by the retailer (assuming it knows $P_w$)

$$Q=\frac{95}{2}-\frac{P_w}{2}$$

or if we rephrase it as a in iverse demand, it is the demand faced by the wholesaler

$$P_w=95-2Q$$

The marginal revenue for the wholesaler is then given by $95-4Q$, which should be set equal to marginal cost

$$95-4Q=P_m+5$$

to find the optimal quantity sold

$$Q=\frac{45}{2}-\frac{p_m}{4}$$

and the demand faced by the manufacturer

$$P_m=90-4Q$$

The manufacturer will then set marginal cost and revenue equal

$$90-8Q=10$$

To optimally sell $Q=10$ units.
| Player| Equilibrium Price | Surplus|
|:-----|:--:|:--:|
|Manufacturer|$P_m=50$|$400|
|Wholesaler|$P_w=75$|$200|
|Retailer|$P=90$|$100|
|Consumers|-|$50|

##M and W merge
With M and W merged $P_m$ doesn't make sense anymore, since it is internalized: it's all happening inside the same firm 
**MW**. Now the unit cost for the merged firm **MW** is 15. All else remains the same. 

So we start by solving the problem for the retailer:

$$100-2Q=P_{mw}+5$$

We can then obtain the quantity sold by the retailer

$$Q=\frac{95}{2}-\frac{P_w}{2}$$

or the demand faced by the merged firm

$$P_{mw}=95-2Q$$

With this demand we can figure out the marginal revenue for the merged firm and write down the first orderd condition for profit maximization


$$95-4Q=15$$

Which means that optimally, the merged firm will sell $Q=20$

| Player| Equilibrium Price | Surplus|
|:-----|:--:|:--:|
|Merged|$P_{mw}=55$|$800|
|Retailer|$P=80$|$400|
|Consumers|-|$200|



##W and R merge
The merged firm **WR** now has marginal cost $P_m+10$. To maximize profits it sets

$$100-2Q=P_m+10$$

So it will sell optimally

$$Q=\frac{90}{2}-\frac{P_m}{2}$$

and the demand faced by the manufacturer

$$P_m=90-2Q$$

which means that to maximize profits the manufacturer should sell 

$$90-4Q=10$$

an optimal amount of $Q=20$.

| Player| Equilibrium Price | Surplus|
|:-----|:--:|:--:|
|Manufacturer|$P_m=50$|$800|
|Merged|$P=80$|$400|
|Consumers|-|$200|

##Monpoly (vertical)

The quantity sold will be $Q=40$

| Player| Equilibrium Price | Surplus|
|:-----|:--:|:--:|
|Monopolist|$P=60$|$2400|
|Consumers|-|$800|

The problem with double marginalization (triple in this case) is that the consumers have to pay for every margin above marginal cost upstream.

When there is competition upstream, for example if the wholesailer get its good from a competitive market of manufacturers
